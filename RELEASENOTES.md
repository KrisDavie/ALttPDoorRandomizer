# Patch Notes

1.4.6

- Restores original Sanc & Quit behavior, if Aga1 is not dead, then no quick pyramid warp
- Fixed problem with Lite/Lean shuffling some fairy caves unnecessarily
- The 300 Rupees item is now marked as priority, so it will not be used as GT junk fill (this matches a change in the VT randomizer)
- Murahdahla is now logically accessible in inverted mode as a bunny. May affect some beatable-only TFH seeds by allowing Moon Pearl to be inaccessible.
- Fixed an issue around PreferredLocationGroups in customizer which would not work with pre-activated Ocraina or priority items.
- Minor fix on triforce text
