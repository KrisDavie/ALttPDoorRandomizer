# Patch Notes

1.4.5
- Logic: Added appropriate enemy logic to GT Mimics 1 and 2 rooms
- Logic: Added appropriate enemy logic to Mire 2 room. Note this does change the default logical strats, due to how enemy kill logic works.
  - Ice Rod + 1 Bomb is now out of logic
  - Fire Rod + 1 Bomb is now out of logic
  - Fire Rod + 1 magic extension is still in logic
  - Byrna + 1 magic extension is newly in logic

(One magic extension is either half magic or a bottle with the ability to purchase a blue or green potion)

In general, making up for a lack of magic extension with a few bombs is something that could be added to the logic. Using the ice rod to freeze an enemy and then using that enemy to deal blunt damage and then using bombs to clear the frozen enemy is another strategy that could be added to the logic someday. If these are important to you, let me know.
