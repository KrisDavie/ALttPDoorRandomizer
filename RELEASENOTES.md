# Patch Notes

* 1.4.7
  - Fixed generation error with Big Key in starting inventory (thanks Cody!)
  - HMG/NL logic fixes by Muffins
  - Enemizer: Disabled Walking Zora in the UW due to crash with Swamola (they ignore a lot of collison anyway)
  - Enemizer: Banned new Mimics from being the randomized bush sprite due to crash
  - "Beatable" or "accessibility: none" can now use randomized trap doors to seal off entire parts of dungeons (was intended, bug prevented the logic skip)
  - Logic error with enemizer and standard should use new enemy logic rules
  - Fixed a bug with the inconsistent treatment of the beemizer setting
  - Fixed an issue with returning Blacksmith in Simple shuffle (when blacksmith is at Link's House)
  - Fixed an issue with dark sanctuary spawn at tavern north door (thanks Codemann!)
  - Various enemy bans for the last few months
